We are committed to respecting the privacy rights of our customers and other users of the Service. This privacy policy (the “Policy”) describes the privacy practices for using the Service.

        <h3>Information Collection, Use and Sharing</h3>

          Collection and Use<br/>

          We collect information from you when you register for the Service, we may ask you for information that may include your email address, name and other information. At your option, you may also provide demographic information (such as gender or age) about yourself, but it is not required.<br/>

          We will use your information for providing and improving the Service, as well as identifying and communicating with you, responding to your requests or inquiries.<br/>

          When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may collect certain information automatically. Such information includes the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device unique ID, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browser you use and other statistics.<br/>

          Unless you ask us not to do so through our “opt-in” or “opt-out” procedure (see next section), we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials, new services, or changes to this Policy.<br/>

          From time-to-time, our Service may request information from you via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you may choose whether or not to participate and to disclose this information.

We will use such contact information to notify the winners and award prizes. We will use survey information for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this Service.<br/>

          Like many websites and similar services, we use “cookies” in order to make it easier for you to use the Service and for us to gather information about the users of the Service.

Please see the paragraph below regarding location information to understand your options with regard to that information.<br/>

          Disclosure and Sharing

          Except for the restaurants and the drivers with which we do business, we will not use, sell, trade or otherwise share or transfer your personally identifiable information with any third party outside of our organization without first providing you with advance notice, except as described in this Policy. We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services, and to assist us in analyzing how users use our Service. These third parties have access to your information only to perform specific tasks on our behalf and are prohibited from disclosing or using your information for any other purpose.<br/>

          We will disclose your information where required to do so by law or subpoena, or if we believe such action is necessary to comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement, or to protect the security or integrity of our Service. We may also release your information when we believe such release is required to enforce our Service policies, or protect ours or others’ rights, property, or safety.<br/>

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>
                      
          The security of your information is important to us, and we strive to implement and maintain reasonable, commercially acceptable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information we store in order to protect it from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. When you submit sensitive information to the Service, your information is protected both online and offline.<br/>

          If a password is used to protect your account and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential.<br/>

          Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is transmitted to us in a secure way through the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and is then encrypted. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.<br/>

          In addition to using encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees or contractors who need the information to perform a specific job can have access to your sensitive information. In addition, the computers and servers on which we store sensitive personal information are kept in a secure environment.<br/>

          Please understand, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. As such, although we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.<br/>

          You must promptly notify us if your credit card, user name, or password is lost, stolen, or used without permission. In such an event, we will remove that credit card number, user name, or password from your account and update our records accordingly.<br/>

          Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction.<br/>

          If you are located outside United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the information, including your personal information, to the United States and process it there. Your consent to this Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.<br/>

          In the unlikely event that individual personal information has been acquired, or is reasonably believed to have been acquired, from us by an unauthorized individual and applicable law requires notification, we will notify the affected users of that breach. We will provide such notice promptly, although notification may be delayed if we or any law enforcement agency determines that notification would hinder an investigation.<br/>

          Third Party Sites: Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services. We strongly encourage you to review the privacy policy of every site you visit, particularly any site that collects personally identifiable information about you.<br/>

          Children: Our Service does not deal with information relevant to children under the age of 13. As such, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from such children. If you are a parent or guardian and you learn that your children have provided us with personal information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers and other systems.<br/>

          Access to Your Personal Information.<br/>

          Any time you would like to see the personal information we maintain about you, you can request a copy of such information. Simply send an email with “Personal Information Request” in the Subject line to the email address indicated below. You can also receive this information by sending a letter to the address indicated at the end of this Policy. We will do our best to respond to your request within a reasonable time. At a minimum, we will contact you within 30 days to tell you approximately how long it will take us to fulfill your request.<br/>

          If your personal information changes and you would like to update the personal information in our records, please send an email requesting those changes to the email address indicated below. Alternatively, you can send us your requested changes by mail to the address indicated below.<br/>

          Changes<br/>

          We reserve the right to update or change this Policy at any time and you should check this Policy periodically. Such changes will be effective immediately after being posted on this page. Your continued use of the Service after we post any modifications to the Policy on this page will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Policy. If we make any material changes to this Policy, we will notify you either through the email address you have provided us, or by placing a prominent notice here on this Policy page or our homepage.
